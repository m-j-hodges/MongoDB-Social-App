# MongoDB Social App


## DESCRIPTION

I created this project to demonstrate my ability to combine Express and MongoDB to create a server that queries a MongoDB and successfully updates records in the database.


## INSTALLATION


Using this app is fairly straightforward. All you need to do is pull the files from Github, and run the app using "node server.js". This app creates a local Mongo Database on your machine which you can then query from.

## USAGE

using the app is fairly easy. All you need to do is download the code from Github and then run "npm install" to obtain your dependencies. Then you can run the app using "node server.js". Then you can start querying routes using Postman or Insomnia.

Here is a short video that shows you how to use the app.
